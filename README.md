# Hwaseong: An English Guide

Have you ever traveled to a different country and wished you could know more of a city? Thatâ€™s how I felt when I first moved to Hwaseong City (from here on, Hwaseong-si), South Korea in 2020. It is a city on the outer edge of Gyeonggi Province, the area that surrounds Seoul. Before moving to South Korea, I tried to do as much research that I could about the city. However, there was only two things that I kept on seeing:
The Hwaseong Serial Murders happened here. It was one of the longest unsolved murder cases in South Korea.
Most results are about Hwaseong Fortress - this is a Unesco site located in the neighboring city, Suwon.

As you can see, there is barely any information about the city in English. As I lived there for 3 years, and as Hwaseong is one of the fastest growing cities in South Korea, I wanted to create a website to help other English-speaking people who may be interested in Hwaseong or will be moving/currently living there now.
