          <p>
            Jeongok Port is known for it's boats and yachts. Visitors can take a
            ride on one of the yachts or boats at an affordable price. The cable
            car ride connecting Jeongok Port to Jebu Island was just recently
            opened. Visitors can now take the cable car to Jebu Island instead
            of wait for the seas to part to drive there. Tando Port in Ansan is
            also a short walk away! There is a path connecting the two ports.
